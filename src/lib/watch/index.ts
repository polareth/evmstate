 * Note: your RPC will need to support `debug_traceBlock`, which we use to get the pre/post state diff.
 *
 * Note: currently, rebase mode is not supported in Tevm; if you create a fork client yourself and want to follow the
 * latest state, you will need to refork the client on every block. Or you can just provide a rpc url and the common so
 * it's handled for you.
 *

 * @returns Promise<() => void> - Unsubscribe function
